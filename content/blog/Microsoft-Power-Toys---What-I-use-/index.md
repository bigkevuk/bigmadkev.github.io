Those that remember Windows 95 & XP we had the powertoys plugin.

Now there is an opensource updated version for Windows 10 & 11 backed by microsoft.

The tools I use the most from it are:
* PowerToys Awake
* FancyZones
* File Locksmith
* Mouse utilities
* Paste as Plain Text
* PowerToys Run
* Video Conference Mute

I'll come back and update what I use in them but though I would just share these for now.
